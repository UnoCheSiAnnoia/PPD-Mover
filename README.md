# PPD mover
This project is a program that should help putting songs into the Project DIVA emulator, [PPD](https://projectdxxx.me/).   
With this you should be able to select a zip file to unzip and directly move it into the selected folder.    
### Disclamer
I am a beginner at programming so this is probably not gonna be a really good project, but I am still trying what I can.   
## How To Use
an important thing to note is that this program works **only with zip files**.   
1. to make this work you first need to select the songs folder, it is usually found in the KHC folder    
on your disk, inside the PPD folder.    
After selecting it if you want to save it for future program uses you need to press the "save folder" button.   
Reasons why I put that button will be explained later.   
2. Now you need to select the zip file that contains the song/s
    1. *you can press the "change folder" to change the folder where you will start when searching for a zip*
3. You can now press the "move" button to unzip the file into the location you selected in step 1
    1. *you can check the "remove .zip" checkbox to automatically delete the zip file after it is extracted*
4. Now you can select a video file and the folder where you want to put it.   
more things about why I am doing it like this later
5. You can press the "move" button to move the video
## FAQ (but not really)
Q: Did someone really make you questions?    
A: No, I am making this up to explain some things is a fancy way.   
Q: Why did you put that "save folder" button?
A: I thought that someone might organize songs folders in various ways and might want to save a general folder, like the songs folder, and then select an exact folder everytime.   
To be really honest, I don't know if what I said is doable in the current program so I might need to work on it
Q: Why do i need to select a folder every time i want to put a video?    
A: Because I have no idea on how to make this more efficient, sorry.   
Q: When will this project be finished?   
A: I don't know, This is my first project so I am exploring things, for this reason even a simple project like this may take a while.   
Q: Did you make anything else before this project?    
A: I think i tried a discord bot with python and i followed a tutorial about Unity, is this enough?    
I also learned some basics of python at school for an activity so aside from the bot I knew some basic python before starting this.   
## Things I want to add
- [ ] Update how the program looks because it is ugly
- [ ] Add the possibility to drag and drop files
- [ ] Add a starting folder also for videos
- [ ] Maybe make an actual release of this
- [ ] Remove some options from the main window and make a menu for them
- [ ] Hide the saves (so not let them be a random .txt file)
- [ ] Make this thing faster to use because it is really slow right now
