# PDD-Mover
this should help putting new songs in the Project Diva emulator, PDD, but since I am making it it won't work for a while

### What should this thing do?
after you select the song directory and the zip file to move, you should be able to move and unzip the file just with a click, putting also a video in there is still work in progress

### DISCLAIMER
While it kind of works now it is still in a really unpolished state and it is missing features so yeah, don't use it
things i still need to add:
* Error handling (had it once but it was bad so i removed it to rewrite it later)
* Saves file fixing (and maybe making them a bit less accessible)
* The whole putting a video thing

well, no one really saw this repository so I don't even know why I am writing all of this, I guess it makes me feel like a real programmer
