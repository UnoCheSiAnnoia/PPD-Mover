# PDD-Mover
this should help putting new songs in the Project Diva emulator, PDD, but since I am making it it won't work for a while

### What should this thing do?
after you select the song directory and the zip file to move, you should be able to move and unzip the file just with a click, ideally it should also be possible
to put the video but i still have not done it.
###DISCLAIMER
since I am doing this thing, it 99% doesn't work. When i will change this part of the text, it will mean it actually does work.
also, I need to rewrite the whole code because it is an hot mess so the first thing put on this github is not completed and works really, really bad
