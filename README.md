# PPD-Mover
this should help putting new songs in the Project Diva emulator, PPD, but since I am making it it won't work for a while

### What should this thing do?
after you select the song directory and the zip file to move, you should be able to move and unzip the file just with a click, putting also a video in there is still work in progress

### DISCLAIMER
While it kind of works now it is still in a really unpolished state and it is missing features so yeah, don't use it
things i still need to add:
* More efficient ways to use the program, right now you don't really save time by using it
* Add Drag and Drop for selecting files or folders
* Fix some selections in the video part, it still works but it should make it easier to search for a video
* Fix the styling, right now everything is with the default windows stlye
* maybe release a build because just a python file is a bit sad

well, no one really saw this repository so I don't even know why I am writing all of this, I guess it makes me feel like a real programmer
