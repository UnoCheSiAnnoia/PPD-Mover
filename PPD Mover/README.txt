I repeat again, do NOT use this code until I say you can, I am a beginner and this is just a project I am doing, besides that it probably does not change any time
at all because I don't really know how to optimize it. 
You may be wanting to ask me why did I make this public, well... I don't know, I wanted to do so, any problems? (yeah, there are many problems with this if I think about it)

About how the program works right now, I'll just make a list about how someone is supposed to use it:
1. select the directory for the PDD songs folder, if you want to save that for future use you need to press the save button (more about this later)
2. select the zip file containing the song or the song pack, maybe it is a bit late to say that but yeah, this works only for .zip files, I don't think 
you can actually select files that are not zip files, but just in case, don't do that, you'll get an error
3. (optional) if you have a folder where you usually put the zip files for the songs (like the download folder for example) you can press the select folder button
and select that folder so whenever you select a song you will start from that folder
4. you can check the checkbox to remove the zip after the file gets extracted into the folder or you can have it unchecked if you prefer keeping every zip file
5. press the move button, it will unzip the file you selected into the folder you selected in the step number 1
6. at this point you should be able to put the videos where you need to but guess what, this feature is still a WIP (more about it later)

Now let's talk about two things, first, the use of the save button for the songs folder, maybe you have a folder where you keep only hatsune miku music, another one
for Rin and Ren, or you might sort the songs for what colour you think about when listening to them, I don't know, but you might want to swap folder often and maybe 
having it saved automatically won't be the best thing, anyways I think I could do some QOL updates on it so I'll see.
second, about the videos feature, the entries and buttons I put there right now are without function, they don't do anything, also by looking at them you can
already understand this won't be so time efficient, I am still thinking about ways to make it faster but I can't find any, so probably that feaure will just be a
way to put songs without directly opening the songs folder, but it won't make ou save time, sorry for that.
One last thing I want to add is about the selection of the starting folder, I thought about making it start automatically in a folder but I noticed some problems:
for example I have moved the download folder so the folder detection did not work well (so yes, I made it because of a problem I have, but there are other people
in the worls who will have the same problem right?). Sorry for the wall of text in this readme, I just wanted to explain something but I am not really good at doing so
also, english is not my main language so sorry if I made any errors
