This project is a program that should help putting songs into the Project DIVA emulator, PPD.
With this you should be able to select a zip file to unzip and directly move it into the selected folder.

I am a beginner at programming so this is probably not gonna be a really good project, but I am still trying what I can.

HOW TO USE
1. to make this work you first need to select the songs folder, it is usually found in the KHC folder on your disk, inside the PPD folder. After selecting it if you want to save it for future program uses you need to press the "save folder" button.
2. Now you need to select the zip file that contains the song/s. 
you can press the "change folder" to change the folder where you will start when searching for a zip 
3. You can now press the "move" button to unzip the file into the location you selected in step 1
you can check the "remove .zip" checkbox to automatically delete the zip file after it is extracted
4. Now you can select a video file and the folder where you want to put it.
5. You can press the "move" button to move the video
